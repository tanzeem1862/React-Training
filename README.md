# React Training - Coding Assessment Solutions

This repository contains the solutions for a two-part React Coding Assessment, built using **Vite**, **React (JavaScript)**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

Both projects utilize: `useState`, `useEffect`, a **Custom Hook**, `useMemo`, data fetching with `fetch`, and basic loading/error handling, as required by the assessment brief.
